## HashiCorp Vault Plugin

This is the (not currently official) Morpheus plugin for interacting with HashiCorp Vault. It is intended to extend upon the native vault integration that currently exists within Morpheus Cypher Core and currently provides support for both KV1 and KV2 engines whereas the native Morpheus integration only supports KV2. Currently this Plugin only implements a Cypher provider, however it can be extended to be a Credentials provider within the future.

Please feel free to extend/add-to this plugin via pull requests.

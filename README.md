## Official Morpheus HashiCorp Vault Plugin

This is the offical Morpheus plugin for interacting with HashiCorp Vault. It is intended to supersede the native vault integration that currently exists within Morpheus Cypher Core and currently provides support for both KV1 and KV2 engines whereas the native Morpheus integration only supports KV2. Currently this Plugin only implements a Cypher provider, however it can be extended to be a Credentials provider within the future.

**Note:**
HashiCorp Vault Cypher Plugin version 1.2.0 is designed to supersede the native vault integration and will use the “vault” mountpoint instead of “hashicorpVault”. Cypher — Morpheus Docs documentation will be updated with how to use the plugin. The plugin will also be made official on https://share.morpheusdata.com/
